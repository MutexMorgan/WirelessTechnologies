### What this mod is about?
This is github repository of my Wireless Technologies mod. The mod introduces you multiple ways of transferring things wirelessly, including power, signals, items, liquids, or pollution.
### Settings
All types of remote transmitters will be possible to disable during the gameplay. So if you want to simply transmit power, but not willing to transfer items remotely, you can disable transmitters of all other types.
### Examples
For example, if you want to simply be able to transmit power for the remote outpost, but move items with trains, you can disable every other remote transmitter in the settings.
Or if you are willing to be able to transmit all kinds of things, you can enable them all.
